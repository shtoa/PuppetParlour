Phygital (physical and digital) experiences allow digital and physical systems to intertwine to create immersion through direct physical interaction with the digital world. Puppet Parlour examines this link by emulating the analog experience of controlling a hand puppet using media pipe, while simultaneously exploring the relationship between puppet and puppeteer, by asking “How can the analog experience of controlling a hand puppet, be mapped and subverted in a digital world?”.
